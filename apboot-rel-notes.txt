        AOS image with 1G link on some boards reported by CIG
v1.5.3.20
    - Balvenie
      - Hardware changed the polarity of PSE enable gpio pin on P2 boards,
        need to change the same in software
v1.5.3.19
    - Balvenie
      - add capabilities to program the inventory information for the power
        board on the Balvenie.
v1.5.3.18
    - Balvenie
      - keep the PSE port in disabled state per PLM.
v1.5.3.17
    - Balvenie
      - display the link status when the link comes up or down. 
      - on Balvenie we were reading the wrong phy hence the link was 
        always coming as zero. define the right phy page and with that
        the link status is read correctly(if its down it reads down and vice
        versa).
      - theres an issue where if the link partner speed is 100 and we try to
        set the speed on mac to 100 it cannot send/receive traffice however if we set
        the link to 1g it comes up fine and cand send traffic with no issues.
v1.5.3.16
    - Balvenie
      - change the image type for Balvenie to 41, because Octomore is using 40
        in wave2 branch.
      - keep the ethernet ports 1,2,3 and 4 in disabled state in apboot,
        since enabling them causes no traffic including ping to go through.
        once the linux starts booting we enable these except port 2 which is not
        used.
      - disable and enable usb power in apboot.
      - enable wireless mac tag to be passed to the linux.
v1.5.3.15

        depending on input power.
      - do not turn of PSE led.
      - do not turn off the three ethernet ports for Balvenie.
v1.5.3.14
    - Springbank
      - support Spansion S25FL256S_64K flash part with non-uniform sector size
            
v1.5.3.13
    - Springbank
     - Issue :- instant image which is 9 MB takes around 8 mins to install
     - removed the unnecessary delays during the spi read/write operations.
     - do a 4-byte compare instead of a byte compare when the image is
       downloaded. this reduces the time to copmare the image in flash. 
     - increase the spi clock to 40 Mhz, SPI can run at a max of 54Mhz
       but keeping at 40 to be safe.
    - this reduces instant image download and install time by 60%.
v1.5.3.12
    - Springbank
     - apboot hangs while rebooting and displays error
       DDR PHY not up.
     - adding three mov assmebly instruction which is a no operation
       but changes the image size, in earlier case(without these changes)
       we think the image size is not aligned with certain size and hence 
       we see the issue. 
     - this seems to fix although we dont know the root cause.
v1.5.3.11
    - Springbank
     - factory_reset command not erasing data on higher address(above
       16M) of 32M flash. switch the bank when reading and accessing 
       region beyond 16M.
v1.5.3.10
    - Hazelburn-h(AP-103H)
     - Per HW, the core voltage of AR9344 is a bit low on some AP-103H, 
        which could cause the AP reboots randomly when performance testing.
        CIG is recommending increase the core voltage by 50mV to fix
v1.5.3.9
    - Tomatin
     - change DDR settings based on recommendation of WNC.
v1.5.3.8
    - Springbank: fix erase fail issue for 16M flash
v1.5.3.7
    - Tomatin
        - Fix watchdog don't reset the board until code relocate to RAM
v1.5.3.6
    - Tomatin/Springbank
      - support 16MB flash on Tomatin and Springbank
      - the image name will be ap20x-16mb-x.x.x.x-xxxxx
            and ap21x-16mb-x.x.x.x-xxxxx

    - Tomatin
        - Fix inventory write corrupt radio calibration data issue.
v1.5.3.3
    - Springbank
        - turn off optimization on certain low level routine files. 
          GCC -O2 has created timing issues.
v1.5.3.2
	- add Service Tag field in inventory TLV for Dell OEM
v1.5.3.1
	- Tomatin
	  - set gpio pin as output for usb power.
          - enable usb power.
v1.5.3.0

	  - initiate APBoot support
	  - addVersion support
	  - 16M flash and 64M DDR RAM support
	  - GPIO pins definition
	  - ETH_CFG setting for 1000M
v1.5.2.12
   - Tomatin
	  - enable the command to verify the calibration data.
v1.5.2.11

         - add a command to verify the calibration data.
v1.5.2.9
        - Springbank
         - display POWER input in apboot.
           springbank can only display DC or non DC.
           we cannot distinguish between AF,POE+,AT.
v1.5.2.8
        - Springbank
         - disable DMA during the ethclose for the ethernet driver
           otherwise we might have some network packets in pipeline
           which woould overwrite the memory thereby corrupting the memory.
         - this was causing memory corruption and we would see lots
           of AOS crashes during boot up because of this issue.
           - this should fix the crash while uncompressing the linux
             kernel on springbank which would result in data abort.
           - this should fix the crash while uncompressing the root
             file system on springbank which would result in unlzma
             crashes.
           - this should also fix random crashes while booting up the 
             image at different modules mainly ethernet driver.
           - most likely this should also fix the flash corruption when
             booting the image from the Flash and rebooting several times.
v1.5.2.7
        - Hazelburn: allow OS image type to be ARUBA_IMAGE_DALMORE
          in case we need this for IAP 14MB support
v1.5.2.6
        - Hazelburn
         - switch to flash bank 1 if failed to boot from bank 2

         - decrease boot delay time
        - Hazelburn
         - set 0 to turn off red LED. only works for P2 board
           onwards.
v1.5.2.4
        - Hazelburn
         - change DDR clock to 215MHz to avoid the interference
           to 2.4G radio.
         - change LED gpios for status green and red. only works for P2 board
           onwards.
         - control Eth LEDs for AR8035.
v1.5.2.3
        - Springbank
         - change LED gpio to not blink Red Led. this only works
           for P3 builds onwards.
         - fix the 10/100 MB issue by removing the Phy address.
         - fix the board reset twice when we issue the reset command.

        - K2: updated DDR settings per Sercomm
v1.5.1.16
	- Springbank: 
	  - invalidate I-cache when doing flush_cache(), to make sure that
	    the CPU sees the right instructions after a boot operation; 
	    was missing from BRCM code (note, not 100% sure that this
	    is needed)
	  - apply part of upstream commit
	    99ffccbd3e5b7bc715e2eed6ea6d36f4020b56d8 to ensure cache is 
	    flushed when booting uImages
v1.5.1.15
	- Springbank: switching the TPM pins to
	  GPIO stupidly broke the TPM diagnostic
	  commands in APBoot; switch the mode
	  of these pins in the board-specific read
	  and write routines -- this works because
	  we never do more than one read operation at
	  a time; if that changes, this needs a cleaner
	  fix
v1.5.1.14
	- Springbank: work around the BSPI unit
	  getting stuck by reading 256 bytes from
	  the base of the flash; keep your fingers
	  crossed
v1.5.1.13
	- Bowmore:
	  - use the DDR2 CAS latency value of 4 as per WNC uboot after 
            running the 4 corner test report.
v1.5.1.12
	- Springbank: disable I2C block for
	  TPM GPIO support
v1.5.1.11
	- Springbank: fix TPM OIAP test
v1.5.1.10
	- Ardmore: enable TPM diagnostic
v1.5.1.9
	- Springbank:
	  - correctly swap MAC counts when passing to Linux
v1.5.1.8
	- Springbank:
	  - enable 'bdinfo' command
	  - pass number of cores in the Aruba tag
	  - move address of boot params to 0x1000 (this must match the kernel)
	  - don't pass memory tags on these boards, as it confuses the BRCM 
	    initialization code
	  - Springbank has 32MB of flash
v1.5.1.7
	- Springbank:
	  - change armv7.ari to armv7ns.ari
v1.5.1.6
	- K2:
	  - store radio calibration data in Flash
v1.5.1.5
	- Springbank:
	  - use cmd_bootm_fsl.c for booting on iProc
v1.5.1.4
	- Springbank:
	  - update most TPM code from latest Corvina boot
	  - add some delays in iproc_i2c.c so that printfs
	    can be removed
	  - The TPM seems to work with these changes
v1.5.1.3
	- Springbank:
	  - fix spansion flash initialization so that the reference
	    board works as expected; missed this during the LDK SPI
	    code update
v1.5.1.2
	- Springbank:
	  - set baud rate to 9600 now that most development is done
v1.5.1.1
	- Springbank:
	  - possible fix for verification failures on 'upgrade boot':
	    - add l2cc_invalidate_and_wait() and call it from
	      aruba_invalidate_dcache()
	    - add iproc_l2_cache_flush_range() and call it from flush_cache()
	      so that memory is in sync after a network transfer completes
	      (this is based on the code in Linux 2.6.34.6 
	      plat-brcm/cache-l310.c (part of ESDK 1.1.0)
	  - updated PHY address for our board so that link status displays
	    correctly
	  - suppress a few messages when booting Linux, as we did on Arran
v1.5.1.0
	- Springbank:
	  - relocate to just below 128MB to
	    leave room for Linux; required
	    changing the cache policy to work
	    reliably; the top 6MB are now
	    treated the same way as 0-16MB.  If
	    APBoot's memory usage goes above 6MB,
	    we may need to change this, but that
	    seems unlikely (and in fact, it is probably
	    only the text space that matters)
	  - corrected code that copies exception vectors
	    to address 0; not sure this is needed
	  - invalidate D$ after writing to flash in
	    aruba_copy_and_verify()
v1.5.0.16
	- Springbank:
	  - Flash:
	    - update most SPI flash code from iProc LDK 3.4.3
	    - add delays in iproc_qspi.c to fix some boot 
	      flakiness; this may not be the right fix
	    - fix a problem with the 'md/cmp' hack; don't switch
	      banks if we're already on that bank, to avoid
	      flushing the prefetch buffers incorrectly
	  - change DDR_CTL_82 to match the reference code; not
	    sure about this either
	  - import print_buffer() from U-boot 2012.10-rc3 for
	    debugging
	  - import min/max fixes from U-boot 2012.10-rc3
	  - suppress another annoying error from the Ethernet
	    driver
v1.5.0.15
	- Springbank:
	  - memory POST for iProc
	    - use QSPI scratch register for POST work
	    - untangle a lot of iProc ifdefs
	    - fix memory range; now runs from 16MB to 128MB
v1.5.0.14
	- Springbank:
	  - suppress a couple of Ethernet driver errors that
	    seem mostly harmless
	  - cosmetic tweak to CPU info display
v1.5.0.13
	- Springbank:
	  - reset button fixes:
	    - can't use GPIO lib prior to relocation, so hand code
	      GPIO accessors
	    - move GPIO initialization into checkboard()
	    - enable reset button in the board config
v1.5.0.12
	- Springbank:
	  - Flash:
	    - fix watchdog issue when flashing OS
	    - don't leave flex mode on when switching to the
	      lower 16MB address range
	    - memory commands leave lower range enabled when done
	    - improve memory commands (md/cmp) by checking for a
	      16MB crossing during the operation, not just at the
	      beginning
	- Build:
	  - minor cleanup of targets so that 'apboot' depends on
	    'u-boot.bin'
	  - Makefile.releng tweaks:
	    - stop building 2-stage Octeon images; we don't care about
	      them
	    - support for building all images without signing them or
	      installing them (useful for auditing changes)
v1.5.0.11
	- Springbank:
	  - snapshot TPM/I2C support
	    - this is a work in progress
	    - added enough APIs to allow us to talk
	      to the TPM, but it is not fully operational
	    - added simple TPM commands; need to update
	      with latest from Corvina
	    - fixed I2C probing
	  - support for 'md' and 'cmp' on flash addresses above
	    16MB
	    - I was not able to construct a scheme that would
	      allow the BSPI to read these addresses in all cases
	      so this resorts to doing a pseduo-bank-switch
	      using the BSPI parameters to tell the CPU to send
	      the upper address byte when "bank 2" is selected;
	      otherwise, it is not sent
	  - relocation only seems reliable if we leave APBoot at
	    16MB; this will cause other problems, but leaving it
	    this way for now
	  - commented out some GPIO pin definitions that are not
	    needed
	  - coded a bunch of support for provisioning image in
	    bank 2, but decided not to do it that way; checking in
	    for possible future use
v1.5.0.10
	- Springbank:
	  - preliminary watchdog support for both Springbank and the 
	    reference board
	  - DRAM:
	    - set lane 0 read data delay to 2 for our SKU ID
	    - update DRAM registers after comparing with Sercomm CFE 
	      drop; not too sure about these
	    - dump a bunch of registers if the DDR PHY fails to come up
	  - Ethernet:
	    - move some debug messages under BCMDBG, not DEBUG
	    - add 'robo' command to dump switch registers
	    - add code to power down ports 1-4 (since network is not 
	      working on P0, not sure about this either)
	  - GPIO:
	    - initialize GPIO driver and mux pins
	    - add 'gpio' command
	    - disable power pins since they are scheduled to be removed from P1
	  - integrate Micron/Macronix 4-byte address support from iProc LDK 
	    3.4.3, along with some other changes like FSR poll support
	  - TODO:

	    - disable 2nd core
	    - investigate DDR more
	    - sort out memory size init (16 or 128)
v1.5.0.9
	- Springbank:
	  - add a bunch of kludges for PCI scanning to avoid
	    seeing the same device on the same bus multiple times
	    (copied code from Linux, but it isn't working, so kludges
	     are needed)
	  - re-enable radio display on reference board
	  - report link status when transmitting
v1.5.0.8

	    (not fully working yet due to PCI issues)
	  - add 'ar5416' command to reference board config for debugging
	  - start of support for reporting Ethernet link status
	  - PCI:
	    - re-enable PCI initialization
	    - fix up support for multiple busses
	    - don't set latency timer on iProc for now
	    - try to ensure we don't have array mismatches in ar5416.c

v1.5.0.7
	- Springbank: snapshot
	  - minor cosmetic cleanup; way more to do here

	    since it was causing corruption
	  - Ethernet:
	    - invert return code to match our older version of eth.c
	    - older code calls halt function unconditionally; ignore the
	      request if the Ethernet state is not active
	  - use 1000 HZ even if CONFIG_IPROC_DIAGS is enabled; should
	    probably clean this up, but without this change network timeouts
	    take forever
	  - byte-swap fixes for DNS
	  - as expected, fix byte-swapping for image header checksum
	  - fix register offsets for SRAB PHY access, they are shifted by 1
v1.5.0.6

	  - add support for the Spansion flash on the 53012ER board
	  - clean up DEBUG macros in mtd.h to avoid DEBUG being set in 
	    lib_armv7/board.c
	  - adjust flash layout since 53012ER board has only 16MB of SPI flash
	  - display flash size correctly, similar to Arran
	  - add -pie to LDFLAGS for ARMV7 platforms so that relocation works
	  - add an option to avoid relocating inventory data; not sure if
	    this is needed
v1.5.0.5
        - Springbank:
	  - apply ESDK 1.1 U-boot patch supplied by BRCM in order to add
	    support for the 53012ER reference board
	  - most of this is NVRAM stuff for that board that we won't use
	    on the Springbank design
	  - TODO: double-check DDR changes
	  - fix up the default environment to be exactly what we want
v1.5.0.4

          - if environment is in the SPI flash, allow it to be 64KB, since
            it won't be accessed before relocation and doesn't need to fit
            in the L2C (I hope)
          - use aruba_flash_read() on iProc
          - don't bother verifying uImage CRC on iProc, same as Arran
          - AP variant will be on card #1
          - move a few iProc libraries from .a to .o so that weak 
            symbols are picked up correctly
          - ensure cmdtable alignment as we do on other
            boards
          - call board_eth_init() for iProc
          - set up default environment
          - define CONFIG_NET_RETRY_COUNT as it usually is

          storage stubbed out for now until we can work on it
v1.3.5.8
        - Dalmore: allow OS image type to be ARUBA_IMAGE_DALMORE
          in case we need this for IAP 14MB support

          - fix MACSec initialization for A1 PHY
          - use direct time-base reads to determine when to blink
            the LED and poke the external watchdog; since the clock
            is driven off of interrupts, we can miss cycles when flashing
            because CFI accesses hold off interrupts
v1.3.4.1
        - Ardmore:
          - fix CFG_FLASH_SIZE
          - fix factory_reset issue with 14MB images

        - Ardmore:
          - watchdog fixes for 14MB image support:
            - split up copy into 64KB chunks so we can pet the
              watchdog when copying into the staging area
            - pet the dog in a few other places just to be safe
          - change CONFIG_SYS_BOOTMAPSZ to 64MB so that we can boot
            the 14MB image with room for the device tree and the stack;
            Linux has been mapping 64MB since commit 
            e8b63761554aca641bd9020447d487bfd85111bf

        - Ardmore:
          - MDIO bus doesn't seem to work for address 0 if TSEC1 is not 
            up, so bring it up, but don't register it since it is not
            connected
          - add ARDMORE_REV_A_PHY_WAR to put the PHY in the right

            traffic test from Arran; not enabled yet
          - get rid of WATCHDOG_RESET_INTERNAL() usage;
            a better fix is to not dereference 'gd'
            unless gd->reloc_off is non-zero
v1.3.1.7
        - Ardmore: don't pet the watchdog from the
          clock interrupt, or many hang conditions won't
          be interrupted

        - Ardmore: 
          - watchdog support
            - fix interrupt init to not clobber the watchdog setting

            - PPC calls watchdog_reset() in some places
              where global data is not available, so
              added watchdog_reset_internal() and
              corresponding macros for these scenarios;
              pets the dog, but won't update LED state; need
              to see how this works when real HW is available
          - fix a problem with generating the

          - re-factor some common routines out of
            cmd_apboot.c and cmd_meshos.c in to apboot-util.c
          - PPC booting uses FIT images, specifying the
            configuration as the board name, e.g.:
                    bootm <addr>#<config>
            this is used to select the correct DTB
          - build correct pci_indirect file; don't

          - printf() support for 'z' and 't' qualifiers
          - fix Ethernet address management for TSEC driver in APBoot mode
          - fix image upgrade logic which never correctly detected the
            end of the flash
          - make malloc() initialization more like other boards; this may
            or may not make any difference
v1.3.0.0
        - Ardmore: 1st 1/2-baked version of APBoot
          running on the P1020WLAN reference board
          - integrate Freescale U-boot support from their 2010.12
            port (SDK 20110709, patched to V1_03)
            - this adds about 200 files and updates many other PPC
              files, in addition to some common file changes
          - add checksum with watchdog support to MD5, SHA-1, and
            CRC-32
          - update of image format header with corresponding
            collateral changes (mostly _ARCH_ replacing _CPU_)
          - update cmd_apboot.c and cmd_meshos.c to handle the
            case where APBoot is at the top of the flash, not
            the bottom
          - TODO:
            - fix PCI bus initialization
            - DHCP DNS server parsing
            - cosmetic cleanup
            - FDT command fixes
            - pass AOS information to Linux
            - finalize flash layout
            - verify that other platforms work without
              issue (all that I've tried build, but
              have not been tested)

          the NMI bit in the COP0 status register
        - this whole thing still seems a little dodgy
v0.0.3.0
        - don't reserve the 1MB of memory for the boot since it doesn't 
          seem to be needed, and compressed images were overwriting some 
          allocations done in the Linux area; removing this is a kludge, 
          but keeps the allocations down below 2MB, where they are safe
        - pet the dog in a few more flash operations in u-boot
v0.0.2.2
        - crude watchdog support

          - disable the watchdog while running the
            Aruba memory test
